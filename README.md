Created a basic level framework as per the requirement in test , created explicit wait and validations what so ever is necessary for both ui and api.
we can clone the solution and run in visual studio directly,
High-Level Approach to API Testing
Understand the API Requirements:
Review API documentation to understand endpoints, request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), request/response formats (JSON, XML), authentication methods, and error codes.
Define Test Cases:

Create test cases based on the API specifications and requirements. Common categories include:
Functional Testing: Validate if the API behaves as expected for valid requests.
Negative Testing: Ensure the API handles invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., incorrect data types, missing required fields).
Boundary Testing: Test the limits of input data (e.g., maximum length of strings).
Exploratory Testing Scenarios
Exploratory testing is an effective way to discover unexpected issues and gain insights into the API's behavior. Here are potential scenarios for exploratory testing:
Unexpected Inputs:
Test endpoints with random or malformed data to see how the API handles unexpected input.
Concurrent Requests:
Simulate multiple users making requests simultaneously to check for race conditions or bottlenecks.
Authentication Variations:
Test API behavior with different types of authentication (valid, expired tokens, revoked tokens).
